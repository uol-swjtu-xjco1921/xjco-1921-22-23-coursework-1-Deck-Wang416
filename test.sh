# TO USE THIS TEST SCRIPT

# FIRST USE ONLY - in terminal type: 
# chmod +x test.sh
# this ensures you have permission to run this script
# you should only need to do this once.

# You can then run with: 
# ./test.sh
# You can save your tests into a file using:
# ./tests.sh > name_of_file.txt
# you can edit which executables to run on line 90.

# we clean up object files and then recompile as standard
# this is because when you may be working across multiple devices
# your object files are not necessarily tranferable, and therefore
# you should always recompile.

    ### Functionality Tests ###

    # to test the functionality, we need to check which 'class' of executable
    # we are working with - echo, comp or conversion. We will do this by looking
    # at substrings from the executable name.

    # note that where diff is used you may see slight differences if you have linebreaks
    # or spaces used differently. Linebreaks at the end of the file are bad practice BUT
    # will be accounted for in the final test.

    # if we have an Echo function:
    if [[ ${testExecutable:3:4} == "Echo" ]]
    then
        # To test echo we will:
        #    - check for the right code and message
        #    - and check that the files match using the diff tool

###### DO NOT REMOVE - restoring permissions
# git will be unable to deal with files when we don't have permissions
# so to prevent you having to deal with untracked files, we will restore
# permissions after running the tests.

# chmod +(w / r) means 'give all users write / read permission for the file'
chmod +w test_data/pgms/bad.out
chmod +r test_data/pgms/ascii/test.pgm
###### YOU CAN EDIT BELOW THIS POINT

# the run_test function has been incrementing both a counter for how many tests have run
# and a counter for passes. We will display this (along with a message for clarity).
echo "------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
echo "You passed $score out of $total"
echo "IMPORTANT: this is a count of tests passed - it is not your final grade."
echo "------------------------------------------------------------------------------"


# OPTIONAL - neither of these will affect your tests
# Many programmers prefer to work from a relatively 'tidy' directory
# and so will ensure any temp files created by the tests are removed
# and any object files are removed.

# remove the files we created during the tests
rm tmp null
# and run make clean to remove object files
make clean
